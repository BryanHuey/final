        <p>
          I grew up in the Bay Area, born in San Francisco but mainly raised in San Jose. After highschool, I attended California State University East Bay, majoring in Computer Science.
          After deciding that path wasn't for me, I changed majors a few times, jumping from writing and psychcology, before deciding to study for a Sociology degree.
          <br> <br>
          After graduating in 2021, I started looking for a UX research role in the technology field. Hoping to combine some of my major intrests, preforming research and technology, I looked for a career.
          Unable to find one for a few years while working retail, I decided to get a certificate in User Experience (UX) and Interface Design. By doing this I hoped to broaden my understanding of the field I want to go into and improve my résumé.
          <br> <br>
          I continue my job hunt, hopefully finding a career soon, because it is very expensive to live in the Bay Area.
